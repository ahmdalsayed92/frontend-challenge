## frontend instabug challenge app configuration: 
- i used node.js to start a local server this link
 (http://jasonwatmore.com/post/2016/06/22/nodejs-setup-simple-http-server-local-web-server) 
 shows you how to start a local server. 

- this app is based on angular 1.6 
- the styling of this app is based on LESS not SASS because i don't use any UI-framework like foundation
 i use my own framwork 
- the LESS files in styles folder is not the full complete framwork i used only what i need but it's scalable 
    which means i can include other components easily.
